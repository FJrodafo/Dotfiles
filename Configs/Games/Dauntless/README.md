Apply the code from [Scalability.ini](./Scalability.ini) file to increase your FPS.

You can also edit the [Engine.ini](./Engine.ini) file to disable frame smoothing (Make sure you have disabled Vsync).

This makes the game look pretty bad but you can turn up the textures/res scale in the video settings and it looks much better.
